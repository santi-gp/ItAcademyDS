One potential disadvantage of K-means clustering is that it requires us to pre-specify the number of clusters K. Hierarchical clustering is an alternative approach which does not require that we commit to a particular choice of K. Hierarchical clustering has an added advantage over K-means clustering in that it results in an attractive tree-based representation of the observations, called a dendrogram.
